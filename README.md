# User Management Script

This is an enhanced **Bash script** for managing users in a Linux environment, specifically tailored for enterprise use. It provides a robust set of features for creating, modifying, and deleting users, as well as managing user groups and enforcing strong password policies. The script is designed to be secure, user-friendly, and compliant with enterprise standards.

     - User ID (UID)
     - Group ID (GID)
     - Home directory
     - Login shell

5. **Logging**:

## Usage

### 1. **Running the Script**
To use the script, simply execute it in a Bash shell:

```bash
sudo ./User_management.sh
```

> **Note**: The script requires root privileges to perform user management tasks.

### 2. **Main Menu**
The script provides a menu-driven interface with the following options:

- **1. Add User**: Create a new user with a strong password and a choice of shell.
- **2. Remove User**: Delete a user, their group, and home directory.
- **3. Modify User**: Modify user attributes (lock/unlock, change password, change primary group).
- **4. List Users**: Display a list of all users with their details.
- **0. Exit**: Exit the script.

### 3. **Logging**
All actions performed by the script are logged to `/var/log/user_management.log`. This log file is created automatically if it doesn't exist, and it includes timestamps and event details for auditing purposes.

```
